# java-algorithms

Initially this started as just a fork of [this repo](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) but quickly grew into 
a testing ground for all things Java interview-prep related.

Contained in this repo are my attempts at:
- Algorithms & data structures from Cracking the Coding Interview (6th Edition)
- Algorithms & data structures from [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/)

If you're interested in preparing for coding interviews, I suggest you:
- Fork [this repo](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) and go through some of it
- Purchase Cracking the Coding Interview and go through their data structures up to, but not including, bit manipulation
- Attempt a wide breadth of problems from [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/)
    - The easy & medium difficulties are probably sufficient
